**C - Doubly Linked Lists**
This project explore the concepts behind and how to use the __Double linked list__ data structure.

The following are some of the programs created as a result:

* A function that prints all the elements of a dlistint\_t list.
* A function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint\_t list.
* A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint\_t list.
* A function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint\_t list.
* A function that frees a dlistint\_t list.
* A function that returns the nth node of a dlistint\_t linked list.
* A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint\_t linked list.
* A function that inserts a new node at a given position.
* A function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint\_t linked list.
