**Dynamic allocation with malloc and free functions**
This project explore concepts of dynamic allocation of memory using malloc and free functions.It includes C programs that:
* creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
* returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
*  concatenates two strings.
* returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
* frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc\_grid function.
