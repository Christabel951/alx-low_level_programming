**Function Pointers in C**
This project is an exploration to find out what and how to effectively use fuction pointers.
Some of the C programs created include:
* function that prints a name.
* function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
* function that searches for an integer.
* program that performs simple operations.
* program that prints the opcodes of its own main function
