**This project explores recursion in C**
The following functions expound on the use of recursion in solving problems
* print a string, followed by a new line.
* print a string in reverse.
* return the length of a string.
* return the factorial of a given number.
* return the value of x raised to the power of y.
* return the natural square root of a number.
