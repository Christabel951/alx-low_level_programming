**Singly Linked Lists in C**
This project is a probe into how to build and use liked lists, when to use them and why to choose them vs arrays.
Some of the C programs include:
*  function that prints all the elements of a list\_t list.
* function that returns the number of elements in a linked list\_t list.
* function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list\_t list.
* function that adds a new node at the end of a list\_t list.
* function that frees a list\_t list.
