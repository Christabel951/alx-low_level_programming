**Variadic functions**
The project explores on the use of variadic functions [how to use va\_arg, va\_arg and va\_end] and const type qualifier in C.
The following are some of the C programs created as a result.
* function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
* function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
* function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
* function that prints anything.
